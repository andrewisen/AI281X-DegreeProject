## Introduction

Within the field of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)<br>
Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be used to aid designers.
For example, designers can use BIM to evaluate different design ideas.
However, some find the existing tool to be hard to use. <br><br>
Designers can instead use Virtual Reality (VR) and create different design layouts in a virtual environment. VR allows designers and users to wear Head Mounted Display (HMD). These let the person wearing the device to be fully immersed in the VR world. This immersion can be used for indoor lighting design.

### Prerequisites
First and foremost, this project requires good understanding of BIM, Programming, Game Development and working with Virtual Reality.<br>
This README file will assume that the reader have basic knowledge of using these tools:<br>

* A (powerful) Windows PC
* Git for Windows
* Revit 2019 or newer
* Unreal Engine 4.21 or higher
* Visual studio 2017 or newer
* Python 3.4 or higher
* Dynamo 2.0.2 for Revit

### Installing
Open your terminal of choice, for example [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)<br>
Make sure to [Change Directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8961334/how-to-change-folder-with-git-bash) to your working directory.
